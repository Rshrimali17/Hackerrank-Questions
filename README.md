# Welcome to my HackerRank Repository 

## What is HackerRank?
[__HackerRank__](https://www.hackerrank.com/) is a place where programmers from all over the world come together to solve problems in a wide range of Computer Science domains such as algorithms, machine learning/ AI, as well as to practice different programming languages like - `Python`, `C`, `SQL`, `JavaScript`, `Linux Shell` etc. and also different programming paradigms like - `Functional Programming`, `Statistics` etc. To know more details about `HackerRank` you can visit [___here___](https://www.hackerrank.com/faq). 


## What this repository contains?

This repository contains solutions of problems from different domains of `HackerRank` that matches my interest. You can see the domains listed below. Most of the problems are solved using - `Python`, `Cpp` & `JavaScript`.
